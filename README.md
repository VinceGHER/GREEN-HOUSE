# GREEN-HOUSE

With a view to using a microcontroller equipped with a temperature sensor, we have
leaning towards the study of building an automated greenhouse. Having no real tools to
our disposition, our project will remain mainly theoretical.
In a greenhouse, many parameters come into play in order to optimize the cultivation of fruits and
vegetables. We have obviously simplified the greenhouse model by only trying to manage its
temperature. Thanks to the rays of the sun during the day, the greenhouse heats up through its
Windows. In summer, when the sun's rays become very intense, the temperature of the greenhouse can
exceed the optimum temperature for cultivation, therefore it is necessary to cool the greenhouse. A
One way to get the greenhouse temperature down is to open the greenhouse windows.
It will be assumed that the outside temperature is always lower than the inside temperature. In
Indeed, the temperature required to grow fruits and vegetables is rarely lower than
high temperatures that are reached during the summer.
